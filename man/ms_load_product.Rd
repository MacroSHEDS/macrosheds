\arguments{
\item{macrosheds_root}{character. The path to the MacroSheds dataset's parent
directory, established with \code{\link[=ms_download_core_data]{ms_download_core_data()}} and/or \code{\link[=ms_download_ws_attr]{ms_download_ws_attr()}}.
If you specified different locations with each of these functions, you'll need to
refer to them separately when loading time-series data vs. watershed attribute data.}

\item{prodname}{character. A MacroSheds product name. Files associated with this
product name will be read and combined. See details for footnotes.
Available prodnames are (for core time-series products):
\itemize{
\item discharge
\item stream_chemistry
\item stream_flux_inst_scaled*
\item precipitation,
\item precip_chemistry
\item precip_flux_inst_scaled*
\item stream_load_annual_scaled**
}

(and for watershed attribute products):
\itemize{
\item ws_attr_summaries
\item ws_attr_timeseries:all
\item ws_attr_timeseries:climate
\item ws_attr_timeseries:hydrology
\item ws_attr_timeseries:landcover
\item ws_attr_timeseries:parentmaterial
\item ws_attr_timeseries:terrain
\item ws_attr_timeseries:vegetation
\item ws_attr_CAMELS_summaries
\item ws_attr_CAMELS_Daymet_forcings
}}

\item{version}{numeric or "latest". The MacroSheds dataset version from which to load data.}

\item{filter_vars}{character vector of variable codes. for products like stream_chemistry that include
multiple variables, this filters to just the ones specified
Ignored if requesting discharge, precipitation, or watershed attributes.
To see a catalog of variable codes, run \code{\link[=ms_load_variables]{ms_load_variables()}} or visit \href{https://macrosheds.org}{macrosheds.org}.}

\item{networks, domains, site_codes}{character vectors of MacroSheds networks/domains/sites to load. Omit to load all.
To see a catalog of site codes, run \code{\link[=ms_load_sites]{ms_load_sites()}} or visit \href{https://macrosheds.org}{macrosheds.org}.}

\item{sort_result}{logical. Ignored if requesting watershed attributes.
If TRUE, and requesting core time-series data, output will be sorted by site_code, var,
datetime. this may add considerable loading time for large datasets.}

\item{warn}{logical. If TRUE, no more than 1 GiB will be loaded into memory without permission,
and you'll get notifications about more recent versions of the MacroSheds dataset, if available.}
}
\value{
For all core timeseries products except load, returns a \code{tibble} in MacroSheds format.
This format is often required in inputs to macrosheds tools, but usually only date, site_code, var, and val columns are required.\tabular{ll}{
   header value \tab column_definition \cr
   date \tab Date in YYYY-mm-dd \cr
   site_code \tab A unique identifier for each MacroSheds site, identical to primary source site code where possible. See \code{\link[=ms_load_sites]{ms_load_sites()}}. \cr
   grab_sample \tab Boolean integer indicating whether the observation was obtained via grab sample or installed sensor. 1 = TRUE (grab sample), 0 = FALSE (installed sensor). \cr
   var \tab Variable code. See \code{\link[=ms_load_variables]{ms_load_variables()}}. \cr
   val \tab Data value. See \code{\link[=ms_load_variables]{ms_load_variables()}} for units. \cr
   ms_status \tab Boolean integer. 0 = clean value. 1 = questionable value. See "Technical Validation" section of \href{https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10325}{the MacroSheds data paper} for details. \cr
   ms_interp \tab Boolean integer. 0 = measured or imputed by primary source. 1 = interpolated by MacroSheds. See "Temporal Imputation and Aggregation" section of \href{https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10325}{the MacroSheds data paper} for details. \cr
   val_err \tab The combined standard uncertainty associated with the corresponding data point, if estimable. See "Detection Limits and Propagation of Uncertainty" section of \href{https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lol2.10325}{the MacroSheds data paper} for details. \cr

Loads MacroSheds core time-series products and watershed attributes from the

\details{
*"instantaneous" (i.e. daily) flux, scaled by watershed area and reported in kg/ha/d.
Note that flux products can also be computed from component products using
\code{\link[=ms_calc_flux]{ms_calc_flux()}}.
**load = flux aggregated by water-year (Oct 1 to Sept 30). Load is computed by various methods,
with MacroSheds-recommended method identified for each site_code-variable-water_year combination.
Scaled by watershed area and reported in kg/ha/yr. See ms_calc_flux for method details.

For some domains, it is possible to request "custom" variants of products, which
are analogous to their standard types, but are calculated according to the methods
employed by the primary source data provider. Examples are Panola stream flux, which
can be loaded via \code{prodname = "CUSTOMstream_flux_inst_scaled"}. Consider these
products to be "secret menu items" for now. You may identify them by searching for the
word "CUSTOM" in your macrosheds_root directory.
